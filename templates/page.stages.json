When you fell pregnant, remember those hormonal surges? Well now your baby is here, it is completely normal (not to mention, expected), to experience a whirlwind of emotions, including an infamous batch of ‘the baby blues’  around day 3-5. Your estrogen and progesterone levels will drop away very quickly and as your milk comes in, you’ll experience an escalation in oxytocin and prolactin. Pair this hormonal shift with (1) the physical recovery from birth, (2) that you have a brand new baby to care for and (3) the fact you now have limited time to sleep, rest and recalibrate … your body and mind will pine for copious amounts of support, empathy, kindness and acknowledgement. Look after your baby. Look after yourself. <\/p>","color":"#0a2657"}},"362692ad-7ba3-4e92-b925-22250859f147":{"type":"decoration-image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Group_113_1.png","decoration_image_alignment":"top","decoration_image_alignment_mobile":"right"}}},"block_order":["8c009e0b-6132-4c00-88dd-39a35d3df848","362692ad-7ba3-4e92-b925-22250859f147"],"settings":{"section_id":"4th-trimester","bg_color":"#a1c5ff","show_ghost_image":true,"ghost_image_desktop_size":"540,
